   * node will notify anyone who is trying to subscribe to this topic name,

   * node.  advertise() returns a Publisher object which allows you to
   * publish messages on that topic through a call to publish().  Once

   * will be automatically unadvertised.
   *
   * The second parameter to advertise() is the size of the message queue
   * used for publishing messages.  If messages are published more quickly
   * than we can send them, the number here specifies how many messages to
   * buffer up before throwing some away.
